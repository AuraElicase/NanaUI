//! Development-only hot reload support for NanaUI applications.
//!
//! This crate owns what is the same for every tier: a filesystem watcher, a
//! debounce that survives an editor's write-truncate-rename, and a jailed read
//! that skips a half-written file. Deciding *what a reload does* stays with the
//! application that owns the state.
//!
//! What a reload can actually reach, and why Rust code cannot be swapped into a
//! live process, is in `docs/reference/hot-reload.md`; [`restart`] carries the short
//! version at the point it matters.
//!
//! # This crate cannot ship
//!
//! `[profile.dist]` inherits `release`, so `debug_assertions` is off in every
//! packaged build and the `compile_error!` below fires. A product crate that
//! grows a dependency on `nana-ui-dev` fails to build rather than shipping a
//! filesystem watcher to users. There is deliberately no escape hatch.
