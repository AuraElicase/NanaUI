//! [`ToastRecipe`]: what a toast looks like, and how a stack of toasts
//! moves.
//!
//! The Overlay family's recipe for the passive notice `Toast` paints. Like
//! every recipe it is the theme answering for the component: how round the
//! toast is, which surface and hairline it stands on, whether it is lifted,
//! how it is inset, what marks its tone before the copy and in which type
//! its title and description are set are design decisions, so a theme
//! states them and a toast only names its tone and its copy.
//!
//! The rest of the recipe is for notices: the progress row a long task shows
//! under its copy, the kind and size of its action buttons, how many lines
//! the copy wraps to, how a toast comes and goes, and how a stack closes up
//! behind one that leaves. The leaf `Toast` sets its title and its
//! description on one line each and plays no motion of its own, so it reads
//! only the look; an assembled toast (`AppContext::assemble_toast`) reads
//! the copy, progress and action rows, and a `ToastStack` the motion and the
//! stack gap.
